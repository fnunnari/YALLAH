We used Unity Version 2017.4.40f1
Blender Version 2.79 (LTS)
YALLAH Blender Plugin Version 180919
YALLAH Unity Plugin Version 180919

There are Scripts for breathing, blushing/paling, blinking, controlling the facial expressions and a script that uses all of those scripts to animate the character (called Videoscript because we used it to create short videos).

Short instructions on how to setup the scripts are in the comments in the scripts. To see how to actually use them look at the VideoScript as example.

The code is still a little bit messy and there are probably bugs, we were also not very consistent with our names, sorry for that.

We also added a different Cornea texture, the iris in the original texture is too big and not very pretty, we fixed that. Although it might only work for the caucasian woman character.
